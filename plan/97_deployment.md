# Filament v4 Deployment Documentation

Based on the official Filament v4 deployment documentation from https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/deployment

## Deployment Preparation

### Authorization
- Ensure users are authorized to access panels in production
- Implement `FilamentUser` interface for user access control
- Configure proper user authorization when `APP_ENV` is not `local`

## Performance Optimization

### Primary Deployment Commands
```bash
php artisan filament:optimize           # Recommended primary optimization command
php artisan filament:cache-components   # Cache Filament components
php artisan icons:cache                 # Cache Blade icons
php artisan optimize                    # Laravel app optimization
```

### Caching Strategies
- Cache Filament components to reduce file scanning overhead
- Use Blade Icons caching for improved icon loading performance
- Clear caches when needed with `filament:optimize-clear`

### Server Optimization
- Enable PHP OPcache for improved performance
- Configure server-specific OPcache settings
- Optimize autoloader with `--optimize-autoloader`

## Asset Management
- Keep `filament:upgrade` in `composer.json` post-autoload-dump script
- Ensure assets are up-to-date during deployment
- Handle asset compilation and optimization

## Production Security
- Implement user authorization when `APP_ENV` is not `local`
- Follow Filament's user access guidelines
- Secure panel access in production environments

## Recommended Deployment Script
```bash
# Typical deployment script sequence
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
php artisan filament:optimize
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

## CI/CD Considerations

### GitHub Actions Workflow Recommendations
Based on Filament's optimization requirements:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow for Filament deployment
- name: Install Dependencies
  run: composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev

- name: Optimize Filament
  run: php artisan filament:optimize

- name: Cache Configuration
  run: php artisan config:cache

- name: Cache Routes
  run: php artisan route:cache

- name: Cache Views
  run: php artisan view:cache
```

### Cache Management for CI
- Clear view cache before tests to avoid compiled template conflicts
- Use `php artisan view:clear` in CI environments
- Consider `php artisan filament:optimize-clear` for fresh deployments

## Production Deployment Steps

1. **Code Deployment**
   - Pull latest code from repository
   - Install production dependencies

2. **Application Optimization**
   - Run Filament-specific optimization commands
   - Cache application components and configuration

3. **Database Migration**
   - Run migrations with `--force` flag in production

4. **Asset Compilation**
   - Ensure frontend assets are built for production
   - Verify Filament assets are properly cached

5. **Performance Verification**
   - Test application performance after deployment
   - Monitor resource usage and response times

## Best Practices

### For Clean CI Runs
- Always clear caches before running tests
- Use consistent environment setup across CI and production
- Implement proper cache management strategies

### For Production Deployment
- Follow systematic deployment approach
- Focus on performance, security, and asset management
- Implement proper monitoring and rollback procedures
- Use environment-specific configuration management

The documentation emphasizes a systematic approach to deployment, focusing on performance optimization, security considerations, and proper asset management for Filament applications.
