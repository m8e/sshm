# Stage 3: CI/CD Pipeline & Production Setup

## Overview
Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, code quality tools, and production deployment features.

## Key Commits
- `05e440a` - feat: implement comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with Laravel Pint integration
- `3531686` - fix: resolve class_attributes_separation formatting in User model
- `50392e1` - fix: resolve CI pipeline failures with database and dependency issues
- `2729539` - fix: add fallback composer update to CI workflows for lock file compatibility
- `04cf9d9` - docs: add GitHub Actions CI/CD status badges to README

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Laravel Pint Configuration
```bash
./vendor/bin/pint --test
./vendor/bin/pint
```
- Custom `pint.json` configuration
- Enhanced formatting rules
- Pre-commit hooks integration

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows
Create `.github/workflows/`:
- `tests.yml` - Test workflow (PHP 8.2/8.3, Pest suite)
- `build.yml` - Build and deployment workflow
- `code-quality.yml` - Code quality assurance

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
```bash
php artisan test --parallel
```
- 149 tests, 482 assertions
- Unit tests for models, services, widgets
- Feature tests for Filament resources
- Database operations testing

### 4. Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
cp scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### 5. Documentation & Badges
- README with CI/CD status badges
- Comprehensive setup instructions
- Security considerations
- Development environment guide

## GitHub Actions Configuration

### Test Workflow Features
- Multi-PHP version testing (8.2, 8.3)
- SQLite database setup
- Composer dependency caching
- Pest test suite execution
- Laravel Pint formatting checks

### Build Workflow Features
- Frontend asset compilation
- Database migrations
- Code formatting validation
- Test suite execution
- Deployment artifact creation

### Code Quality Workflow
- Laravel Pint validation
- PHP syntax checking
- Composer security audits
- Dependency validation

## Quality Assurance Tools
- **Laravel Pint**: Automatic code formatting
- **Pest**: Modern PHP testing framework
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Local quality gates

## Deployment Features
- Environment-specific configurations
- Database migration automation
- Asset compilation pipeline
- Security scanning integration

## Outcome
A production-ready application with automated testing, code quality enforcement, and reliable deployment pipeline that ensures code consistency and reliability across all environments.
